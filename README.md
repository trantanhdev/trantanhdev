<em>I took this picture after 6 hours of climbing under wet and hot weather in Ta Nang, a very famous but dangerous trail in Viet Nam. It was terrible when you have to jump out of your comfort zone but the gift from mother nature was worth it. I think about that time whenever I face obstacles. So never never never give up.</em>
